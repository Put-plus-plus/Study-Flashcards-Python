Digital flashcards, that first ask you what I word means in a different language and then gives you the answer, is a convenient way of learning a foreign language. Asked in English, the answer appears in transcribed Ukra as well as in uk chyr letters, using tkinter, gogole trans, and transcribe. In python. Consisting of the Glosary Class and the Flashcards class.
